1.What is OpenShift Dedicated?OpenShift Dedicated is a cloud service that provides a complete OpenShift cluster that is configured for high availability (HA) and dedicated to a single customer (single-tenant). Red Hat Operations manages OpenShift Dedicated, providing improved security and years of operational experience with OpenShift in development and production. OpenShift Dedicated also includes Red Hat Premium Support, which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.2. What are Init containers used for?Init containers, which run before application containers and can contain utilities or setup scripts not available in an app image, are provided by the OpenShift Container Platform. Before the rest of a pod is deployed, you can utilise an Init Container resource to conduct activities.In addition to application containers, a pod can have Init Containers. Setup scripts and binding code can be reorganised using init containers. An Init Container can do the following:• Contain and run utilities that, for security reasons, should not be included in the app Container image.• Contains setup tools or custom code that isn't included in the app image. For example, using sed, awk, python, or dig during setup does not necessitate creating an image FROM another picture.• Use Linux namespaces to provide them different filesystem views than app containers, including access to secrets that app containers don't have.Before the next Init Container is started, the previous one must finish successfully. As a result, Init Containers make it simple to prevent or delay the launch of app containers until certain conditions are met.3. Why should you use OpenShift?OpenShift provides a standard platform for business units to host their apps on the cloud without having to worry about the operating system. This makes it very simple to use, build, and deploy cloud-based apps. It provides managed hardware and network resources for all types of development and testing, which is one of the essential characteristics. PaaS developers using OpenShift can construct their environment based on their needs.4. What is the OpenShift Container Platform by Red Hat?To design and deploy better apps quicker, a hybrid cloud, enterprise Kubernetes platform is needed. The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides a unified hybrid cloud basis for developing and scaling containerized applications.Red Hat's on-premises private platform as a service solution, OpenShift Container Platform, is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and built around a core of application containers powered by Docker, with orchestration and management provided by Kubernetes. Red Hat's experience in identifying and promptly providing solutions for vulnerabilities in both the platform and the containerized apps running on it will benefit the OpenShift Container Platform. Red Hat also has experience efficiently integrating new components with the OpenShift Container Platform as they become available, as well as modifying technology to meet the needs of individual customers.5. What is the OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI)?The OpenShift CLI tool is a command-line tool for managing OpenShift applications. We can manage the application's life cycle from start to finish using the OpenShift CLI. It provides basic and complex application setup features. It also has tools for managing, distributing, and adding new apps.You can create applications and manage OpenShift Container Platform projects from a terminal using the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). After you've installed the CLI, you can use the oc command to access it. In the following scenarios, the OpenShift CLI is ideal:• Working directly with the source code of the project• OpenShift Container Platform operations can be scripted.• Project management while bandwidth is limited and the web console is unavailable.A few of the major CLI commands are listed below:• Create a new project with the oc new-project command. • Create a new application with the oc new-app command.• To see the pods for the current project, use the oc get pods command.• To access logs for a specific pod, use the oc logs command.• To see the current project, use the oc project command.• To get information about the current project, including as services, deployments, and build configs, use the oc status command.• The oc api-resources command displays a list of the server's supported API resources.• To see the description and fields for a specific resource, use the oc explain command.• To see a list and description of all available CLI commands, type oc help.
