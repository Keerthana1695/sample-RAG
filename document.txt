Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (German: Deutscher Industrie- und Handelskammer, DIHK) is a German 'chamber,' similar to an English guild but is required under German law and provides political influence of a trade union. This organization was formerly known as the Deutscher Industrie- und Handelstag or DIHT.

Following a series of legal proceedings in several instances due to inadmissible communications by the DIHK because it had exceeded the limits of its authority, these limits of authority were specified in the amendment to the Chamber of Industry and Commerce Act.[1][2] As of 1 January 2023, the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce e. V. was transformed into the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) on January 1, 2023. This changes the legal form: the DIHK is transformed from a registered association organized under private law into a body under public law. The chambers of industry and commerce are legal members of the DIHK.
